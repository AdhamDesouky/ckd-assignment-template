# ## Task 1: Data Pipeline
# **Instructions:** # 1. Load the `kidney_disease.csv` file.
# 2. Drop all categorical (string) columns to isolate the numerical lab values.
# 3. Handle missing values (`NaN`s).
# 4. Scale the features to prevent data leakage.
# 5. Perform an 80/20 train/validation split.

# ## Task 2: The Engineered Failure (Baseline Model)
# **Instructions:** Build and train an unregularised Dense network. Plot the training and validation loss curves to visually prove it overfits.

# Write your Baseline Model code here


# %% [markdown]
# ## Task 3: The Clinical Solution (Engineered Model)
# **Instructions:** Build a second model using regularisation techniques (e.g., L2, Dropout, LeakyReLU). Train it and plot the curves to demonstrate the reduction in overfitting.

# ## Task 4: Evaluation & Mathematical Justification
# **Instructions:** # 1. Render the confusion matrices for both models.
# 2. Print the final validation Recall for both models.
# 3. Answer the justification question below.
